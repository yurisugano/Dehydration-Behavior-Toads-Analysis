# Dehydration Behavior in Invasive Toads Analysis 🐸💦

## Overview
Unravel the mystery of adaptive behaviors in invasive versus native toads in South Africa. We're not just hopping around; we're delving into raw behavioral data to uncover insights and trends.

### Problem Statement 🤔
Quantifying behavior can be a tricky business. This project takes it to a whole new level by analyzing toads' behavioral metrics captured through BORIS (Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software). This treasure trove of information is then used to compare invasive and native species in terms of their behavioral responses.

### Approach 🛠
The core feature of this project is a comprehensive R script that takes raw behavioral data as input and churns out detailed statistics and eye-catching graphs. We used R along with the ggplot2 library for plotting.

### Instructions 📘
1. **Requirements**: Make sure you have R and ggplot2 installed.
2. **Setup**: Clone the repository and run locally.
3. **Execution**: Just execute the script; the data is already included.

### Results 📈
- **Publication**: The findings were featured in Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology. [Read the paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00265-020-02866-5).

### Progress Indicator 🚦
