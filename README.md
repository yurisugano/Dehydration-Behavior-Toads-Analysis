This project aims to identify adaptive behavioral pattern differences between invasive and native guttural toads in South Africa. 

I performed behavioral coding using the Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software (BORIS) package. After independent validation by a colleague, I analyzed and presented the results for a manuscript. This repository goes through the data treatment, data exploration and conclusions.
