## Dehydration Behavior in Toads 🐸

### Overview

This project studied the behavior patterns of invasive and native toad species in response to dehydration. After the behavioral assay, we coulnd't just hop around! Here, we navigate the path from raw behavioral data to insights regarding adaptation and evolution on a short time scale! 

#### Problem Statement 🤔
Novel behavioral paradigms require consistent data analysis. Here, we propose a few meaningful metrics that can be obtained from behavioral coding of the dehydration challenge task. Toads' behavioral metrics were captured through BORIS (Behavioral Observation Research Interactive Software). The complex raw data is then used to compare invasive and native species in terms of their behavioral responses.

### Approach 🎯
The core feature of this project is a comprehensive R script that takes raw behavioral data as input and churns out detailed statistics and simple yet eye-catching graphs. We used R along with the ggplot2 library for plotting.

#### Features 🛠️

- Complete R script for data analysis and graph generation
- Behavioral summary stats

### How To Get Started 🚀

#### Requirements 📋

- R and the necessary packages

#### Running The Project 🏃‍♀️

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Open R and run the script.

### Project Status 🚀

#### What's Done ✅

- Statistical framework defined and implemented
- Generation of publication quality figures

#### What's Next 🌟

While the project is considered complete, there are possibilities for extending its applicability to broader use-cases. 

#### Open for Collaboration 🤝

If you are implementing the dehydration challenge behavioral assay, or if you believe your behavioral assay has a similar analysis framework, let me know! We can work to make this a more general behavioral analysis script.
